Modified version of gCodeVisualizer in order to be used with slic3r to estimate the print time without internet access.

Just Download it,
edit the estimate.bat or estimate.sh script to match your path, and add to slic3r:
Print Settings->Output Options->Post-processing-scripts: [the path of the .bat or .sh script] 
[Linux example] /home/username/gCodeViewer/estimate.sh
[Windows Example] C:\dev\gCodeViewer\esimate.bat



gCodeVisualizer - a web-based visual gcode viewer and analyzer.
Available online at http://gcode.ws/

If you want to use it locally with chrome - you will need to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" command line parameter,
which is unsafe (and you should never browse internet with that option "on").
